# Setup and Python Basics

This section introduces **Python syntax and core building blocks**: variables, data types, input/output, and operators.

## What you will learn

- How to install Python and run scripts.
- Variables and basic data types (int, float, bool, str).
- Taking input and printing output.
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

## When to use these concepts

You use these basics in **every** Python program, from simple scripts to advanced algorithms.

## Common mistakes

- Confusing `input()` (string) with numeric types. Always cast when needed, e.g. `int(input())`.
- Integer division vs float division: `//` vs `/`.
- Forgetting that Python is dynamically typed but types still matter for operations.

## Example problems

1. Read two integers and print their sum, difference, product, and integer division.
2. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
3. Given a radius, compute the area and circumference of a circle.
